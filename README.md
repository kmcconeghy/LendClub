Modeling of peer to peer loans for investing insight and programming practice

Purpose:
  1) I invest in peer to peer loans as an alternative asset class, this repository is meant to extract and analyze these loans and determine a predictive model which maximizes return on investment.
  2) I am new to github and this project will serve to learn how to develop a repository. 
  
Result:
  A shiny app which demonstrates the loan characteristics which predict return.
